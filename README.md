# ASP.NET MVC 4 Fundamentals #

## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-On Labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn ASP.NET MVC 4.  Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

This Hands-On Lab is based on MVC (Model View Controller) Music Store, a tutorial application that introduces and explains step-by-step how to use ASP.NET MVC and Visual Studio. Throughout the lab you will learn the simplicity, yet power of using these technologies together. You will start with a simple application and will build it until you have a fully functional MVC Web Application.

### Repository Structure ###

In the **root** folder of this repository you will find the Hands-On Lab (HOL) document, **HOL.md**. Before beginning with the HOL exercises, make sure you have followed all the required steps indicated at the setup section of the HOL document. 

In the **Source** folder you will find the source code of each of the exercises, as well as the assets and setup scripts. Throughout the HOL you will be instructed to open and explore the different solutions from the source folder. It is typically comprised of the following subfolders:

- **Assets:** This folder contains files that are used throughout the exercises.
- **_Exercise Name_:** Each exercise that requires a programming solution has its own code folder.
  - **Begin:** The begin solution is the initial incomplete solution that you will finish by following the steps of the corresponding exercise.
  - **End:** The end solution is the final result you will achieve at the end of an exercise.
- **Setup:** This folder contains the dependency files and the setup scripts necessary to initialize specific configurations of the lab, being its execution is required in the majority of the Hands-on Labs.
